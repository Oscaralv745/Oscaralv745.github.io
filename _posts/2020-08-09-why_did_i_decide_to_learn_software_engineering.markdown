Deciding to study software engineering, honestly, wasn’t my first choice. Right after highschool I wanted nothing more than to become a highschool english teacher. However, since just about all colleges were too expensive, I decided to take a few years off of school and figure out what I really wanted in a career. I had looked at everything from phlebotomy to aircraft mechanics. A couple of months ago though, I stumbled across software engineering and instantly knew that THIS is the field that I wanted to be in. I loved how it’s a field that’s always changing and you’re always having to learn new things, how most days you sit and debug your code for hours trying to make all the pieces fit like a puzzle, and especially how the software engineer community is so diverse and unique. After falling in love with software development I tried learning by myself. However, I quickly realized that even with all the information and Udemy courses that are out there, I needed something more structured. That’s when I found Flatiron, out of all the coding bootcamps that I looked at Flatiron was the only one that I felt truly confident in and that I would get the structure and support I was looking for.
